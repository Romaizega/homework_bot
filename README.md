# **Project "Telegram bot-assistance"**  
The "Assistant Bot" project is an educational application that implements the functionality of an assistant bot for the Telegram messenger. This bot helps send messages with the status of homework checks and provides logging of each action in the console, as well as saving logs to a separate file.

### **Main Features**  
- **Sending messages with homework check status:** The bot allows users to request and receive the status of their homework checks.  
- **Logging actions in the console:** Every action of the bot is logged and displayed in the console for tracking the application's performance.  
- **Saving logs to a separate file:** Logs are also saved to a separate file for further analysis and monitoring of the bot's operation.  

### **Main Benefits of the Project**  
The "Telegram bot-assistance" project provides an opportunity to understand the fundamentals of creating bots for Telegram and to explore various techniques and development tools:  
- **Python Telegram Bot:** The Python Telegram Bot library is used to create the structure and functionality of the bot.  
- **.env files:** To securely store sensitive information, a .env file is used, and environment variables are parsed using load_dotenv().  
- **Custom Logger:** A custom logger is created for logging the bot's actions, with the ability to configure the level of detail in the logs.  
- **Custom Exception:** A custom exception is implemented to handle errors and exceptional situations within the application.  
- **Unix Timestamp:** Unix Timestamp is used for convenience in tracking the timing of events.  

### **Conclusion**  
The "Assistant Bot" project is an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of bot development for Telegram and to apply various programming concepts in practice. It helps to master different tools and approaches to creating educational projects using Python and libraries for working with the Telegram API.
